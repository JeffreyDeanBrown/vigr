SYNOPSIS
  vigr.py [GFF_FILE] [OPTIONS]
  vigr.py [OPTIONS]
  vigr.py -t


DESCRIPTION
  Vi-like GFF Reader
  a simple terminal-based program for viewing GFF files, focusing on 
  gene sequencing analysis results. Typical use case is viewing genes in 
  annotated contigs.


OPTIONS
  -h        outputs this menu

  -g [...]  name of a GFF file to view

  -f [...]  name of an nucleic acid FASTA file to pair with the GFF file
            (allows for viewing the actual sequence when zoomed in)

  -t        TEST MODE: loads a test eukaryotic gene to try out
            (specifically CG11023 from 2L of Drosophila melanogaster,
             which comes pre-loaded with gffutils: 
             https://daler.github.io/gffutils/index.html )


CURRENT CONTROLS AND COMMANDS:
  h             : help (this menu)
  scroll wheel, : move up/down
  arrow keys,
  j/k
  gg            : move to begging of sequence
  G             : move to the end
  Ctrl + O      : Go back to previous location
  z             : zoom in/out (toggle), identical to :zoom


EX COMMANDS (activated with ":"):
  help           : this menu
  seqs           : sequences available in this GFF file
  seq [...]      : select a sequence from the seqs list (the seq number in 
                   the list, not the name)
  type [...]     : limit display to listed type(s), comma or space delimited
  children [...] : shows the children of named feature. The name is outside of 
                   the parenthesis, ex: CDS: name(description of gene) 
  reset          : resets all children and type constraints
  zoom           : zoom in/out (toggle), identical to z
  [interger]     : move to this location, can be comma delimited. Recognizes
                   the labels "bp","kbp","mbp" 
                   (i.e. "10kbp" = 10,000 = 10000bp, etc)
  space [...]    : change the spacing of features to entered # of columns
